so long

to do in v 0.2:

get the name of the player (and the coalition)
confirm the name and coalition and let user retry
save the name of the player in the file, save its score, save the current time.
read the file, sort the results (score first, time second), show 10 highscores
do not exit the game, let people try again with different name without restarting the program,

to do in the future:

player has more than one life
different enemy types
player can fight back
real time score
smoother movement
more animations
more maps
