# and_thanks_for_all_the_fish
so long

Work still very much in progress
- no norminette
- possible memory leaks
- ugly code
- not the best documentation

Disclaimer:
This project was done outside of my core studies in a hope to demonstrate how far the projects in the C can get you after studying at 42 for several months, as well as to provide a bnding experience and a friendly competition to the possible future students. Use as is. It currently works best (only) in FullHD, 1920x1080 resolution.

How to use:
- Get linux
- Git clone the repo
- go to the folder in your favourite terminal
- run 'make'
- run the game ./and_thanks_for_all_the_fish
- Have fun

to do in v 0.2:

get the name of the player (and the coalition)
confirm the name and coalition and let user retry
save the name of the player in the file, save its score, save the current time.
read the file, sort the results (score first, time second), show 10 highscores
do not exit the game, let people try again with different name without restarting the program,

to do in the future:

player has more than one life
different enemy types
player can fight back
real time score
smoother movement
more animations
more maps
